# Beginner.dev

Beginner.dev is a website made by myself, another beginner, to teach others web development. That may seem a bit strange, but they say the best way to learn is to teach. So, that is the goal of this site. For me to be able to learn these concepts by teaching others so that I can gain a much deeper understanding of these concepts, and hopefully land my first job in the programming world as a web developer.
